                a variable is a named storage location that can hold a value.
                Variables are used to store data values that can be accessed and
                manipulated throughout a program.

                a variable is a named storage location that can hold a value.
                Variables are used to store data values that can be accessed and
                manipulated throughout a program. Here are some key points about
                variables:

              what is the DOM ?
              <br />
              <h4 className="mt-3">
                The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that
                represents an HTML or XML document as a hierarchical tree
                structure, allowing programs to dynamically access and
                manipulate the document's content, structure, and style.

            </li>
            <li className="my-5">
              what is callback function
              <br />
              <h4 className="mt-3">
                A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to
                another function and is executed after the completion of that
                main function. This allows you to run a function after another
                function has finished its execution.

              what is the hoisting in js ?
              <br />
              <h4 className="mt-3">
                Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function
                declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope
                during the compilation phase. This means you can use variables
                and functions before you declare them in your code.
