                represents an HTML or XML document as a hierarchical tree

                A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to
                another function and is executed after the completion of that
                main function. This allows you to run a function after another
                function has finished its execution.

                Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function
                declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope
                during the compilation phase. This means you can use variables
                and functions before you declare them in your code.

                an object is a complex data type that allows you to store and
                organize data in a structured way. An object can be thought of
                as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique
                identifier and each value can be any valid JavaScript data type,

                JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight
                data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and
                write and easy for machines to parse and generate. In
                JavaScript, JSON is commonly used to transmit data between a
                server and a web application or between different parts of an
                application. Key Points about JSON in JavaScript: Format: JSON
                format is text-based and consists of key-value pairs. Keys are
                strings. Values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays,
                booleans, or null.

              difference between fetch and Axios method for API calls ?
              <br />
              <h4 className="mt-3">
                Built-in: The fetch API is built into modern browsers, so no
                additional installation is required.
                <br />
                Syntax: It uses a more verbose syntax, especially for handling
                JSON data.
                <br />
                Error Handling: Only rejects the promise on network errors, not
                on HTTP errors (like 404 or 500).
                <br />
                No Interceptors: Does not support request and response
                interceptors.
                <br />
                No Automatic JSON Transformation: You need to manually transform
                the response to JSON using response.json().
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Axios</strong>
                Library: Axios is a third-party library that needs to be
                installed via npm or yarn.
                <br />
                Syntax: Provides a cleaner and more concise syntax.
                <br />
                Error Handling: Automatically handles HTTP errors and provides
                more informative error messages.
                <br />
                Interceptors: Supports request and response interceptors,
                allowing you to modify requests or responses before they are
                handled.
                <br />
                Automatic JSON Transformation: Automatically transforms JSON
                data, so you donâ€™t need to call response.json().
                <br />
                <br />
                Fetch is great for simple requests and is built into the
                browser, making it easy to use without additional dependencies.
                <br />
                Axios offers more features, such as interceptors, automatic JSON
                transformation, and better error handling, which can be very
                useful for more complex applications12.

                A single-threaded language is one that executes one task at a

              <h4 className="mt-3">
                Scope: localStorage is scoped to the entire origin (domain and

                <br />
                <br />
                Persistence: Data in localStorage persists even after the
                browser is closed and reopened. It does not expire unless
                explicitly deleted. Storage Limit: Typically around 5-10 MB per

                <br />
                API: <br />

                Persistence: Data in sessionStorage persists only for the

                Arrow functions in JavaScript are a simpler way to write
                functions. They were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and
                have a more concise syntax compared to traditional functions.
                <br />
                Key features <br />
                <br />
                1. **Shorter Syntax**: <br />- Arrow functions use {`=>`} (fat
                arrow) and often require fewer characters. <br />
                - No need to use the `function` keyword. <br />
                - For a single-line function, you can omit the `return` keyword
                and curly braces. <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                javascript <br />
                const square = x {"=>"} x * x; // One parameter, no need for

                  the other hand, the === operator compares the values of two

                  variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the
